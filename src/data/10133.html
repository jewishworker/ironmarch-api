<h3>The Background</h3>
<p>
  In 2016, the Boston University campus was
  <a
    target="_blank"
    href="http://www.bu.edu/articles/2016/police-release-video-of-suspect-in-hate-poster-distribution/"
    >vandalized</a
  >
  by a Neo-Nazi hate group &#8211;
  <a
    target="_blank"
    href="https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/atomwaffen-division"
    >The Atomwaffen Division</a
  >. This incident was one of Atomwaffen Division’s first public acts, and led
  to a massive media uproar, but the culprits were never caught.
</p>
<p>
  According to the Southern Poverty Law Center:<br />
  &#8220;AWD is organized as a series of terror cells that work toward
  civilizational collapse. Members, who can be fairly described as
  accelerationists, believe that violence, depravity and degeneracy are the only
  sure way to establish order in their dystopian and apocalyptic vision of the
  world. AWD’s chief influences are James Mason, Charles Manson, Joseph Tommasi
  and William Pierce. Their strategy for promoting and establishing national
  socialism can be traced back to The Order, the violent and capable white
  supremacist terror cell founded by Robert Jay Mathews in the 1980s&#8221;.

    >recent</a

  <a href="/">leak of data</a> from the fascist forum, Iron March, (where
  Attomwaffen as well as Vanguard America got their start) finally reveals the
  identities of the individuals involved, along with a trove of information
  showing that they were extremely active in Atomwaffen and other hate groups.
  We consider these members to pose an active an immediate danger to their
  respective communities.
</p>
<h3>The Trace</h3>
<p>
  Iron March user <a href="/user/10133">rekse_</a>, in several direct messages
  to other members, states that she was one of the people who not only
  <a href="/message/18324#msg-18324">carried out the vandalism</a>, but also
  <a href="/message/18089#msg-18089">designed the stickers</a>.
</p>

<p>
  In another direct message to Iron March administrator Alex Slavros, she
  identifies her accomplice as “Weisse” (referring to IM user
  <a href="/user/9304TheWeissewolfe">TheWeissewolfe</a>), who was later
  identified as
  <a

    href="https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/437pkd/the-obscure-neo-nazi-forum-linked-to-a-wave-of-terror"
    >Devon Arthurs</a
  >, the Atomwaffen Division member who purportedly converted to Islam and
  murdered two of his roommates, Andrew Oneschuk and Jeremy Himmelman, both of
  whom were also Atomwaffen members.

  In <a href="/message/18292#msg-18292">several</a>
  <a href="/message/18139">messages</a> and <a href="/post/50229">posts</a> made
  by rekse_ , she indicates that she is a female MIT student in a STEM field,
  and <a href="/post/50229">20 years old</a> as of March, 30th 2016, later
  admitting in May of 2016 to being connected to the username &#8220;<a

<p>
  In the core_members_posts.csv table, there was a field msg_ip_address where an
  IP address was logged for each and every direct message. rekse_&#8217;s user
  ID was 10133, and for several direct messages her IP address was logged as
  107.11.70.51.
</p>

<p>
  This IP address
  <a target="_blank" href="https://archive.is/24KgL">traces</a> to Zanesville,
  Ohio, a town of about 25,000 just east of Columbus. Assuming the “1996” in
  rekse_’s email which she used to sign up for the account (francaise1996<span
    class=""
    >@gmai</span
  >l.com) refers to her birth year, she would have graduated high school in
  2014.
</p>
<p>
  A simple google search for &#8220;2014 Zanesville MIT&#8221; leads to the
  following<a

  about Lauren Ashley Paul from Zanesville, OH, who graduated from West
  Muskingum High School in 2014 and was accepted into MIT that fall to study
  physics. This news story single-handedly supports the identifying information
  rekse_ made in Iron March posts about her a) home state, b) college, c) age,
  and d) field of study.

  After the stickers were put up, user rekse_ stops posting under that account,
  but instead starts posting under a new account,
  <a href="/message/22343">schönundweiß. </a>Luckily for us, she
  <a href="/message/22343#msg-22343">confirms</a> that this is her new account
  in a direct message to another user via her signature &#8220;Rekse Kai&#8221;.

<h3>Sister&#8217;s Death</h3>
<p>
  On Iron March, rekse_ aka schönundweiß
  <a href="/message/22789#msg-22789">states</a> that a very traumatic family
  event occurred in early 2017.
</p>
<img src="https://ironmarch.s3.wasabisys.com/10133/rekse5.png" />
<p>
  She also <a href="/message/23047#msg-23047">posts</a> a chat thread of a
  conversation that had occurred between two Iron March users on anonymous chat
  platform Omegle, where the user talks about how &#8220;Impulse&#8217;s&#8221;
  sister died. She confirms this as well, as she is talking in a direct message
  to another user about a loss in her family.
</p>
<img src="https://ironmarch.s3.wasabisys.com/10133/rekse6.png" />
<p>
  During that same time, in late February of 2017, Lauren Paul&#8217;s sister
  Madison Paul,
  <a
    target="_blank"
    href="https://www.legacy.com/obituaries/name/madison-paul-obituary?pid=184290850"
    >committed suicide</a
  >.
</p>
<h3>National Socialist Black Metal</h3>
<p>
  In 2015, during her time at MIT, Lauren Paul was a DJ for the college radio
  station WMBR under her &#8220;necrotism&#8221; show. Her
  <a target="_blank" href="https://track-blaster.com/wmbr/playlist.php?id=19375"
    >set lists</a
  >
  (<a target="_blank" href="https://archive.is/e5slW">archive</a>) regularly
  included Burzum and Peste Noir, two of the most high-profile NSBM (national
  socialist black metal)
  <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_neo-Nazi_bands"
    >bands</a
  >.
</p>
<img src="https://ironmarch.s3.wasabisys.com/10133/Burzum.png" />
<p>
  In January, 2017, Paul posted a video to her just recently deleted YouTube
  account, “Rekse Kai”, in which she covers a song by Death in June, a band that
  is
  <a
    target="_blank"
    href="https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2017/03/07/statement-regarding-soleilmoon-recordings-and-death-june"
    >popular with Neo-Nazis</a
  >
  for their fascist imagery, such as the
  <a
    target="_blank"
    href="https://www.adl.org/education/references/hate-symbols/totenkopf"
    >totenkopf</a
  >, or “death’s head” (this band is also a favorite of recently-doxxed Iron
  March user

    target="_blank"
    href="https://twitter.com/WANaziWatch/status/1194740414516826113"

<p>
  Lauren Paul&#8217;s sister Madison, was also a fan of National Socialist Black
  Metal, as evidenced by her Instagram posts [<a
    target="_blank"
    href="https://www.instagram.com/p/u-6xzXNE01/."
    >1</a

    target="_blank"
    href="https://www.instagram.com/p/ntnqtOtE7g/,"
    >3]</a
  >. Note that Madison and Lauren both liked National Socialist Black Metal band
  Burzum, whose lead front man Varg Vikernes was arrested by French Terror
  Police in 2013 for a suspected terror

</p>
<h3>Activities and Involvement</h3>
<p>
  As shown in the first screenshot of Paul’s direct messages, mere days after
  Atomwaffen’s Boston University vandalism, Atomwaffen leader Devon Arthurs’
  conversion to Islam left Lauren Paul looking for another “Muslim-free” fascist
  organization to join.
</p>
<p>
  Paul went on to <a href="/message/18284#msg-18284">conspire</a> with users
  Zeroangle (identified as Evan Gillwood from Carlisle, Pennsylvania) and
  Stealth_24 (who also uses the alias “arundel” on IronMarch; he identifies
  himself as Reading, MA resident
  <a href="/message/18679#msg-18679">Jared Casalinuovo</a>, who was 16 at the
  time) to ‘revive’ the 1930s American fascist organization “the Silver Legion”.
</p>
<p>
  Atomwaffen member Andrew Oneschuk (user Borovikov), who was eventually
  murdered by Arthurs, was also
  <a href="/message/18222#msg-18222">involved</a> in early organization of the
  Silver Legion.
</p>
<p>
  As with Atomwaffen, Lauren also
  <a href="/message/18100#msg-18100">designed propaganda</a> for The Silver
  Legion.
</p>
<img src="https://ironmarch.s3.wasabisys.com/10133/silverlegion.png" />
<p>
  During this time, Paul and Casalinuovo experienced a brief scare when an
  antifascist comrade, posing as user “<a href="/user/13049">Bos_Naz</a>” on
  Iron March, set up a honeypot that grabbed an IP address tracing back to her
  as an MIT student, but her identity was never revealed.
</p>
<p>
  In a direct message to Iron March administrator, Alex Slavros, Paul
  <a href="/message/18324#msg-18324">states: </a>“I am worried because I attend
  university and will likely get kicked out if I am found as the culprit. Which
  would mean I&#8217;ve wasted a lot of money and a lot of effort just to have
  my life ruined over some stupid stickers”
</p>
<p>
  Although Casalinuovo was not involved in the vandalism at BU, his IP was also
  revealed, which led to a <a href="/message/18548#msg-18548">visit</a> from
  local police, but he was never arrested or charged.
</p>
<p>
  The Silver Legion was a short-lived experiment, which eventually
  <a href="/message/20282#msg-20282">crumbled</a> by August, 2016. Paul’s last
  post as rekse_ was in August, 2016, but by December, 2016, she opened a new
  account with the username schönundweiß.
</p>
<p>
  In a <a href="/message/22343#msg-22343">direct message</a> to Lauburu88
  (identified as
  <a
    target="_blank"
    href="https://taskandpurpose.com/leader-of-charlottesville-white-nationalist-group-was-a-marine-corps-recruiter"
    >Dillon Hopper</a
  >, leader of American Vanguard/Vanguard America), Paul identifies herself as
  rekse and discloses her involvement with Atomwaffen and Silver Legion, while
  expressing interest in joining Hopper’s organization.
</p>
<p>
  American Vanguard suffered several setbacks and constant infighting, and
  Lauren Paul’s Facebook page linked to a hollaforums thread about
  <a
    target="_blank"
    href="https://hollaforums.com/thread/9809051/politics/i-am-angry-angry-about-american-vanguard-part-2/6.html"
    >this infighting</a
  >, suggesting other members knew her identity and attempted to reveal her
  personal information to others within the organization.
</p>
<p>
  A faction of former American Vanguard members later
  <a href="/post/13768">broke off</a> and formed a group called “<a
    href="/message/22714#msg-22714"
    >The Aryan Underground</a
  >”, which Lauren Paul later joined. Aryan Underground has been linked to acts
  of vandalism in California and Virginia. Given her past history designing
  propaganda for Atomwaffen and The Silver Legion, it is likely, but unconfirmed
  at this time, that she also designed material for The Aryan Underground.
</p>
<p>
  Lauren Paul’s final post as schönundweiß was a message to Odin (Brandon
  Russell) on May 7, 2017, less than two weeks before
  <a
    target="_blank"
    href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/paz8q7/how-devon-arthurs-went-from-neo-nazi-to-muslim-to-alleged-killer"
    >Devon Arthurs</a
  >
  killed his two Massachusetts-based Atomwaffen accomplices and roommates,
  Andrew Oneschuk and Jeremy Himmelman.
